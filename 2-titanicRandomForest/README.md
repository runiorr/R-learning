# Titanic dataset using Random Forest

Here, I'm using Kaggle's famous dataset, Titanic. I used a random forest model and got around 83% accuracy the first time (12/31/2021).
I intend to come back to this later project and do some feature engineering to see if I can get higher accuracy with this model.
